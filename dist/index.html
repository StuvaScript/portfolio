      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        Trading in my work boots for a comfy chair, I made the career jump from
        the brewing industry to embark on a new journey into the world of
        technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        With a strong desire to learn and an unwavering self-driven attitude,
        I'm currently teaching myself HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I
        actively participate in several web developer groups within the vibrant
        tech community here in Portland, OR. By staying involved and engaged in
        these groups, I'm able to keep up-to-date with the latest industry
        trends, continuously improve my skills, and contribute to the growth of
        the local tech scene.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time, I enjoy creating music, indulging in fine Belgian beer,
        and honing my skills at the local rock climbing gym.
